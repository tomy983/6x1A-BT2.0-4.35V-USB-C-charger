# 6x1A-BT2.0-4.35V-USB-C-charger
6 1S lipo cells charger with BT2.0 connectors - 1A charge current (each) - USB-C PD powered

Untested project.

The way it should work is:

12V via USB-C PD is requested. If the supply will comply 12V Vbus goes trough an 8A buck conveter to deliver 5V to each of 6 individual 4.35V 1A charger IC.

A green LED indicates 12V rail from PD present.

Green and red leds near each BT2.0 connector indicates charging status.
